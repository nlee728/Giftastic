# Giftastic

When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate and if the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.

Under every gif, its rating (PG, G, so on) is displayed.

This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
