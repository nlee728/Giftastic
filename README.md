# Giftastic

> An application that utilizes Gipy API to show gifs.

## Getting Started

When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate and if the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.

Under every gif, its rating (PG, G, so on) is displayed.

## Features

Preset buttons allow the user to quickly choose a series of gifs. 

Users can add buttons to the preset list using a form.
